# This sucks: current versions of Popsn are entirely inflexible as to the data received: they

# synchronization conflicts when setting up multi-master database synchronization.  The bits added
# here (which must be an array of 0 or 1s) will be hard-coded into the most significant bits of the
# value, then the remaining 53-bit determined randomly.  E.g. 1 reserved bit is enough for 2
# servers, 2 is enough for 4, etc.  Each server in a cluster should have a different bit pattern
# with exactly the same number of fixed bits.  Should be empty for a single server file server.
